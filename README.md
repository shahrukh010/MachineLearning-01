# Machine Learning Practice

This repository demonstrates a workflow for predicting a target variable using synthetic data and linear regression.

## Project Structure

- `data/` \- Raw and processed datasets.
- `models/` \- Model definitions and saved models.
- `src/` \- Source code for data generation, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- `notebooks/` \- Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
- `tests/` \- Unit tests for code reliability.
- `configs/` \- Configuration files for experiments.

## Workflow

1. **Data Generation:** Synthetic data is created with multiple features.
2. **Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, encoded, and scaled.
3. **Model Training:** Linear regression is used for prediction.
4. **Evaluation:** Model performance is measured using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ².

## Requirements
